# Screen Tools Demo

This is a demo of using a .NET Framework C# class of utilities to automate screen interactions.

The demo looks for "Still Watching?" on a streaming webcam website in a full-screen browser, and clicks on the screen when necessary. It also looks to see if the site has frozen and presses F5 to restart it. Also, if the webcam page goes out of full-screen mode, it clicks the "full-screen" button.
